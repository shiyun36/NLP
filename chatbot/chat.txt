[3/8/23, 2:15:21 PM] Lionel Lee NOC BKK Programme Manager: Dear Peng Kee and Tun Leng,

 

Need a small favour.

 

Megan (copied) is helping to produce a new NOC Corporate Video. She was wondering if there are 1 or 2 outstanding students in your locations/regions, from the Jan 23 and Jul 23 cohorts. These are students that are perhaps playing starring/high-level roles in their startups, e.g. Product Lead, Marketing Head, etc.

 

This fits into the overall narrative of the video, where we hope to position the NOC program as one where students are leaders in their startups, and not just interns/workers.

 

Can quickly poll your teams and let us know?

 

Appreciate your help!
[3/8/23, 2:15:27 PM] Lionel Lee NOC BKK Programme Manager: any volunteers
[3/8/23, 2:15:35 PM] Lionel Lee NOC BKK Programme Manager: corporate video

[24/8/23, 3:10:45 PM] Lionel Lee NOC BKK Programme Manager: would like to feature NOC students and showcase their experiences overseas on our social channels.

Our plan is to present 'A Day in the Life of,' where we capture their daily routines and incorporate casual and fun questions to make it engaging.

We would appreciate it if you could recommend a student who would be keen to share their experiences with us.

Here are some ideas for the segment:

What inspired you to pursue NOC? Share your 'Wow' moment!
Did you do any "cultural crash courses" before jetting off? How did that go?
Share a funny blooper or cultural misunderstanding you experienced at work! 
Did you discover any hidden talents during your internship?
Did you have any "treat yourself" moments with exotic food or quirky experiences during weekends?
Any heartwarming friendships forged during your time abroad? We want to hear those bonding stories!
Now that you've lived the NOC life abroad, any tips for aspiring NUS students?
Please let us know which student you recommend, and we'll reach out to them to discuss further. Thank you
[24/8/23, 3:11:00 PM] Lionel Lee NOC BKK Programme Manager: anyone wanna share?
[25/8/23, 9:11:08 AM] Lionel Lee NOC BKK Programme Manager: GRO, we would like to seek your help to nominate 2 students from each region who have completed the NOC programme to work with them on developing how to maximise learning while overseas. The nominated student should be able to articulate, confident, willing and enthusiastic to share about their overseas learning experience.

 

If possible, appreciate it if you could get back to us latest by 25 Aug 2023 (Fri).

 😅
