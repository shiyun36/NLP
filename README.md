1. Job_search_project utilises the Google Cloud CTS Job search API and LinkedIn APIs to scrape the most recent job availability post information based on certain keywords and industries, job scope, type of job (internship, full-time, part-time, contract)
2. They then extract the most common keywords for skill sets required in the job scope, application deadline, job title and function, employer, location etc. to see if it matches our own skill sets, and also to find a trend in the most popular skills required in each role, and most popular jobs in companies, and most popular job opening timings.
